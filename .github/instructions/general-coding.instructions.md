# General Coding Standards
- Prefer small, composable functions. Avoid God objects.
- Fail fast; validate inputs at boundaries.
- Log actionable messages only; avoid noisy console logs in production.
- Use dependency injection for testability when practical.
- Document non‑obvious decisions with one‑line comments.
